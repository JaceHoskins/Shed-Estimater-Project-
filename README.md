Web Scraper For Shed Project Construction 

My Shed Estimator Project was a tool used to web scape the home depot website to automatically generate an Excel file that can be manipulated to change quantities and run total functions to accurately depict the total cost for the project. I needed a shed on my property to house lawn equipment so I sketched building plans and estimated the materials needed. With the increased cost of building materials, I wanted to accurately track my total cost for the build and compare as prices fluctuate. To speed up the process I wrote a web scraping tool using selenium that pulled my purchase list of materials from the website and automatically uploaded it into a CSV file ready for editing.
